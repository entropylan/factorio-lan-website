## Is there Internet?

We have a combination of VDSL, Starlink and 5G to provide around 450mbps of bandwidth. We also use [LanCache](https://lancache.net) to speed up game downloads.

## Is alcohol allowed?

Yes. The venue is not licensed, so you can bring your own alcohol. Please drink responsibly.

## I have a question that isn't here.

Contact us on Discord and we'll be happy to help!
