When it hits 5AM and you realise you need to actually get some sleep, there's a few options.

## Indoor Sleeping

If you snore, there's the changing rooms. Far away from anyone else, you should be safe from retribution.

If you don't snore, there's an indoor sleeping room just off the main LAN hall. Plenty of space for airbeds, campbeds and sleeping bags.

## Hotels

There's a [Holiday Inn](https://www.hireadingwest.co.uk/) just 5 minutes walk from the venue.

You can also find other hotels and Air B&Bs nearby.

## Camping

There's lots of grassy areas to put a tent up, just don't put it on the football pitch. On Sunday you will be woken up by people training their dogs. Sorry.
